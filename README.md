Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the dominant global health issues that may come up as serious complications of kidney failure and cardiovascular diseases if early not detected. The conventional diagnostic tools occasionally do not succeed in identifying CKD at the beginning stage, due mainly to the complicated interactions between different medical risk factors and the imbalance in patient data. Machine learning has demonstrated immense potential in medical diagnostics by producing precise and automated disease prediction models. The present study addresses the issue of CKD detection on the basis of CAD model improvement in ML system through the use of the ensemble machine learning technique and thus achieve higher classification accuracy and reliability
In this research, several machine learning models are used, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to better detect CKD. It is also deployed of a Stacking Ensemble model, which combines the individual classifiers to provide more accurate predictions. The dataset for this research comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was collected from patient medical records and includes test cards about blood, urine, and other clinical indicators. Data pre-processing steps, such as missing value imputation, feature normalization, and class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), are performed for the better learning of the models from the data.
It was found in the experiments that the Stacking Ensemble model leads to the best accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 1.0, which are higher values than the ones obtained by using the individual classifiers. As for the Random Forest and XGBoost models, they perform well with AUC-ROC scores of 0.988 and 0.970, respectively, while for the Decision Tree model, a lower generalization capability is observed. These results have only revealed that ensemble learning techniques significantly improve CKD prediction accuracy by taking advantage of the unique strength of the combination.
This project has significant real-world implications, particularly for early CKD diagnosis and medical decision-making. By integrating machine learning-based predictive models into clinical workflows, healthcare professionals can identify high-risk patients early, reducing the chances of misdiagnosis and enabling timely intervention. The proposed model can be incorporated into electronic health record (EHR) systems to assist nephrologists and other medical practitioners in assessing CKD risk and recommending further diagnostic procedures.
To use this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Matplotlib. The provided Jupyter Notebook includes the complete implementation, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Clone this repository and run the notebook to explore the results, modify the models, and experiment with different machine learning techniques.
While the model has achieved high accuracy, further improvements can be made by validating it on larger and more diverse datasets. Future work should also focus on improving the interpretability of predictions using explainable AI techniques such as SHAP values, ensuring that healthcare professionals can understand and trust the model's decisions. Additionally, integrating this model into real-world clinical applications will require further testing, optimization, and regulatory compliance to ensure its practical usability in healthcare settings
